# PHPCS git pre-commit hook

## About

Auto installed git pre-commit hook for running [PHP Code Sniffer](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer)
code checking to PSR2 coding standard compliance. It checks only files that are to be committed.

Inspired by [Enforce code standards with composer, git hooks, and phpcs](http://tech.zumba.com/2014/04/14/control-code-quality/)

## Installation

Install `wickedreports/phpcs-pre-commit-hook` with composer require command:

    composer require "wickedreports/phpcs-pre-commit-hook"

Or alternatively, include a dependency for `wickedreports/phpcs-pre-commit-hook` in your composer.json file manually:

    {
        "require-dev": {
            "wickedreports/phpcs-pre-commit-hook": "*"
        }
    }

To enable code sniff, Ð°dd to `post-install-cmd` and `post-update-cmd` in `composer.json` installation script:

    "scripts": {
        "post-install-cmd": [
            "App\\Installer::postInstall"
        ],
        "post-update-cmd": [
            "App\\Installer::postInstall"
        ]
    }

Then run `composer install` or `composer update`. `pre-commit` hook will be installed or updated if it already exists.

## Usage

Run `git commit` and pre-commit hook will check your committed files like if you run

    php phpcs.phar --standard=PSR2 --colors --encoding=utf-8 -n -p /path/to/file.php
